My 42nd assignment! Finally, react! I had a lot of fun making something akin to a pokemon card within the bounds of this assignment.

1. I created a functional component named Header, and it has both a background image and a name overlaying it. For this I chose Trevenant made sure to help the text contrast enough on the image.  
2. I created an about section which also overlays the card, similar to a card text box. The opacity is lowered to allow for some of the background art to peek through, and I used part of bulbapedia's description of trevenant for the paragraph.  
3. I created a class component named Contact and added a simple email address and github logo you can click on to be linked to my profile.
4. Lastly, I created a functional component called App to import and display all of my other components on the page.
