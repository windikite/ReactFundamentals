        <h3>Pokedex Entry</h3>
        <p>Trevenant can control other trees by using its roots as a nervous system. It uses this ability to trap people who harm its forest and will curse people who cut down trees. However, it is very kind to forest-dwelling creatures and Pokémon that reside in its body. Trevenant hates Fire-type Pokémon, so lumberjacks usually bring them to repel it. It is even believed that Trevenant has consumed people, although it is unclear whether this is fact or rumor. </p>
